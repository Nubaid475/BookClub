        <H2>About Cuisines</H2>
        <p>Cuisine is a characteristic style of cooking practices and traditions, often associated with a specific culture. Cuisines are often named after the geographic areas or regions that they originate from. A cuisine is primarily influenced by the ingredients that are available locally or through trade. Religious food laws, such as Hindu, Islamic, and Jewish dietary laws, can also exercise a strong influence on cuisine.</p>

        <p>Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional         cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent. Given
        the diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially and use
        locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits. Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in
        particular Hinduism, cultural choices and traditions. The cuisine is known for its extensive use of spices and
        herbs. Staple foods include rice, wheat, and lentils. Popular dishes include biryani, tandoori chicken, samosas, and
        various types of curry.</p>
