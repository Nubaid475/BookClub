                <H2>About Cuisines</H2>
                <p>Cuisine is a characteristic style of cooking practices and traditions, often associated with a specific
                    culture. Cuisines are often named after the geographic areas or regions that they originate from. A cuisine
                    is primarily influenced by the ingredients that are available locally or through trade. Religious food laws,
                    such as Hindu, Islamic, and Jewish dietary laws, can also exercise a strong influence on cuisine.</p>

        <h1>Indian Cuisines</h1>
        <img src="https://media.istockphoto.com/id/868408746/photo/assorted-indian-dish.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=XLsAk571Z2kEe_x6TnXWSzsG95-2agp-TcYswQrKHuo=" alt="Alternative Text">
        <p>Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional         cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent. Given
        the diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially and use
        locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits. Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in
        particular Hinduism, cultural choices and traditions. The cuisine is known for its extensive use of spices and
        herbs. Staple foods include rice, wheat, and lentils. Popular dishes include biryani, tandoori chicken, samosas, and
        various types of curry.</p>

        <p>Mesoamerican Roots:
        The foundation of Mexican cuisine lies in the foodways of pre-Hispanic Mesoamerican civilizations, such as the Olmec and
        Maya, who domesticated maize (corn) and developed techniques like nixtamalization.
        Spanish Influence:
        The arrival of the Spanish brought new ingredients and cooking techniques, including wheat, cattle, milk, cheese, and
        spices like cinnamon, which now feature prominently in Mexican dishes.
        Regional Variations:
        Mexican cuisine is diverse, with regional variations influenced by geography, climate, and available ingredients. For
        example, the south features dishes with Mayan influences and uses unique herbs and spices like hoja santa, while the
        north is known for its beef and chile-based dishes.</p>

        Russian cuisine emphasizes nourishing, warming meals suitable for the cold climate.
        Simple Ingredients, Bold Flavors:
        Dishes often utilize readily available ingredients like potatoes, cabbage, beets, and mushrooms, with a focus on natural
        flavors.
        Regional Variations:
        Due to Russia's vast size and diverse ethnic groups, regional variations in cuisine exist, with dishes like pelmeni
        (dumplings) and blini (pancakes) popular across the country.
        Soups and Porridges:
        Soups like borscht (beetroot soup) and shchi (cabbage soup) are staples, along with porridges made from grains like
        buckwheat.
        Meat and Fish:
        Meat dishes, particularly pork, beef, and chicken, are common, as are fish dishes, often featuring smoked or pickled
        preparations.
        Pickled and Fermented Foods:
        Pickled vegetables and fermented dairy products are popular due to their preservation qualities.
        Drinks:
        Kvass (a fermented bread drink) and vodka are traditional beverages, while tea is a common daily drink.
        Holiday Traditions:
        Russian cuisine features special dishes for holidays, such as Kulich (Easter bread) and Christmas duck or piglet.</p>
